The following autogenerated tables contain a representative set of potential use
cases for this package, along with measurements that summarize each case's
performance, compilation, and memory usage:
- run time (best of several trial measurements)
- compilation time (as reported by the compiler)
- overall level of optimization (type stability, constant propagation, etc.) and
  allocations during run time (as reported by the garbage collector)
- total allocations during compilation and first run (as reported by the garbage
  collector and, when possible, the Julia process's resident set size estimator)

The rows of the tables are highlighted as follows:
- ```@raw html
  <span style="color:darkturquoise">light blue </span>
  ```
  indicates better optimization and either an improvement or no change in run
  time, compilation time, and total allocations
- ```@raw html
  <span style="color:royalblue">dark blue </span>
  ```
  indicates better optimization and either slower run time, slower compilation,
  or more total allocations
- ```@raw html
  <span style="color:mediumseagreen">green </span>
  ```
  indicates similar optimization, either faster run time or fewer allocations
  during run time, and either an improvement or no change in compilation time
  and total allocations
- ```@raw html
  <span style="color:khaki">yellow </span>
  ```
  indicates similar optimization, either faster run time or fewer allocations
  during run time, and either slower compilation or more total allocations
- ```@raw html
  <span style="color:mediumorchid">magenta </span>
  ```
  indicates no change in performance and either an improvement or no change in
  compilation time and total allocations
- ```@raw html
  <span style="color:silver">light gray </span>
  ```
  indicates no change in performance and either faster compilation with more
  total allocations or slower compilation with fewer total allocations
- ```@raw html
  <span style="color:gray">dark gray </span>
  ```
  indicates no change in performance, compilation time, or total allocations
- ```@raw html
  <span style="color:indianred">red </span>
  ```
  indicates a deterioration in performance, or no change in performance and
  either slower compilation or more total allocations

Rows highlighted in gray present no clear advantage to loop unrolling, while
those highlighted in red present a clear disadvantage. It is recommended that
you only call unrolled functions when your use case is similar to a row in one
of the remaining categories, each of which demonstrates some advantage to loop
unrolling.

The tables are also printed out by this package's test suite, so they can be
compared across different operating systems by consulting the
[CI pipeline](https://github.com/CliMA/UnrolledUtilities.jl/actions/workflows/ci.yml).
