Since this return type depends on the index n, the compiler needs to insert a runtime lookup into the method table that determines which method of length to call, length(::Tuple{Int64, Int64}) or length(::Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}), and this triggers allocations.For the example of unrolled_add_lengths, the compiler instead infers the return types of itr[::Core.Const(1)], itr[::Core.Const(2)], and so on for every index into itr. Then, it compiles a call to length for each of these return types, and it inserts a runtime switch instruction that determines which result of length to return for a particular value of n. As long as length itself only returns one type (in this case, Int64), this ensures that unrolled_add_lengths has no intermediate type instabilities.In other words, unrolled_applyat combines multiple methods for length and getindex into a single method, replacing the inefficient method table lookup that switches between them with a simpler switch instruction.\ntip: Tip\nWhen should getindex be replaced with unrolled_applyat?The specific example above could be simplified by using mapreduce, instead of using a for-loop in conjunction with unrolled_applyat:@allocated mapreduce(length, +, ((1, 2), (1, 2, 3)))However, there are often situations in which it is not possible to replace loops with function calls, like when those loops are parallelized over CPU or GPU threads.
